Role 1 — Product Owner

User story:
As a NetSuite end user, I want to be able to edit the External ID field, so that I can better manage data.

Acceptance criteria:
1. User Event script adds External ID field to form. Places it in System Information tab if tab is visible
2. SDF project is able to be deployed using suitecloud project:deploy command
3. User edit of field persists when user clicks save on record in NetSuite

Done means:
- Tests: use SDF JEST tests
- Docs: admin documentation for how to 1) install, 2) configure, and 3) troubleshoot. use markdown formatting
- SDF deploy readiness: create all files so that suitecloud project:deploy will succeed

Avoid:
- nothing right now.
