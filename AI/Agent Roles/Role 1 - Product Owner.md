# Role 1 - Product Owner (User)

## Purpose
Define what should be built and when work is done.

## You Provide
- User story and acceptance criteria
- Definition of done (tests, docs, SDF deploy readiness, etc.)
- Explicit non-goals (what not to change)

## Template
- User story:
- Acceptance criteria:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
- Done means:
- Avoid:
- Deployment controls:
  - Record targeting (`RECORD` for all records or specific types):
  - Status (`TESTING` or `RELEASED`):
  - Deployed (`T` or `F`):
  - Log level:
  - Audience/access controls:

## Guardrails
- Be specific enough that implementation can be scoped to a small set of files.
- Call out any records, roles, permissions, or environments that matter.
